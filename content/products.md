## LitestX

We are thrilled to announce the latest release of our LiTest application, which has undergone a significant makeover in terms of functionality. Our dedicated team of developers has worked tirelessly to bring you the most advanced version yet, packed with exciting new features and improved ease of use.

Adding functions has never been simpler! With our intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can effortlessly arrange the sequence of functions and add related Daqs' properties or Events' properties in the Function-Line section. The distinct color scheme used for objects in the Function-Line provides a visually appealing overview of the entire application. Our developers firmly believe that this new Function-Line section empowers users with greater control over their Machine-Tests within the LiTest application.

But that's not all! The Function-Line also introduces a valuable feature â€“ the ability to create loops for individual functions or groups of functions. This powerful property allows users to repeat their tests in a loop, with a desired count, enabling thorough testing and analysis.

Additionally, users now have the flexibility to apply up to four tracks of Events or Daqs to one or more functions, expanding the range of possibilities and enhancing the depth of their tests.

Experience the next level of testing efficiency and flexibility with the enhanced LiTest application. Upgrade now and unlock a world of new possibilities for your testing needs.

Don't miss out on this transformative update! Download the latest version of LiTest and harness the power of streamlined functionality for your testing processes today.
