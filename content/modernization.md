# What is Application Modernization

> In simple terms, software modernization, or legacy modernization, or legacy application modernization is the process of replacing or upgrading older software.

### Reasons for Modernizing Legacy Applications
 The main drivers for legacy applications modernization fall into two categories: eliminating the risks and costs associated with supporting old technologies and taking advantage of the new ones.

 ### As Bill Gates once stated:
> #### "The only big companies that succeed will be those that obsolete their own products before someone else does."


# How to Start Modernization?

In real life, companies have different levels of ambition and risk appetite, as well as constraints like budget, time, resources, and dependencies between applications. The best starting point is the assessment of existing applications to identify the legacy ones and possible modernization options. For each option, you can then estimate the effect versus costs and risks.

It is important to stay reasonable with modernization requirements. For instance, scalability is often overrated, leading to unnecessary costs and suboptimal strategies.
